# Case Study- Venmo

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company- Venmo 

* When was the company incorporated? The company was incorporated in 2009

* Who are the founders of the company? The company has two co-founders Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The idea of the company actually started with a frustration of the current method of sending money in the early 2000s, the two roommates were trying to help a friend start up a business. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? The duo actually got about 1.2 million dollars in seed money, from there the journey continued, they later sold to Braintree an up and coming fintech company, which was later bought out by paypal for $800 million dollars. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

In the early 2000s and even to this day there was a problem with being able to instantly pay someone you owe money back, this was the modern days equivalent to cutting a check. In my opinion venmo coupled with apps like splitwise have created a better platform to lend money. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

I believe that Venmo acts as the social media of the digital payments industry. Venmo’s main market appeared to initially be millennials and gen-z because it was a safe and easy way to transfer money. In comparison to its competitors Venmo has no fees associated with sending money- while the traditional units like Western Union do charge – plus a delay in payments. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Due to how the business is set up they utilize the ACH method so there are less fees associated with user transfers, they also have it set up where you can not overdraft it just pulls from the Primary Bank Account. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 

they can be classified as B2C or P2P.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The app has really grown with the audience that uses it, you can make a payment fun and interactive with emojis, you are able to share your experiences with your friends or the public or just make it private between you and the individual fulfilling the request. They are now offering a credit card that would be through the parent company of paypal. The company has also made it a more competitive environment that the traditional banks will have to move with the times or risk becoming obsolete. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The current competitors are Google Pay, Apple Pay, Square, Zelle, Facebook Messenger.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Venmo forced many of the traditional banks to reconsider how they allowed customers to interact with each other, it gave customers a space to freely send up to $7000 dollars to their peers within minutes. The app also proved that we can move away from credit cards and cash payments therefore providing small businesses a better way to streamline their payment process. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

One of the core metrics for P2P domain is how many transactions have been processed through your system, as well as how many users are participating- when Venmo first started they actually did not have much business until Paypal made a big campaign push to start using it. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Venmo while initially the trailblazer for the P2P transactions now has the competition of Google Pay, which is also available internationally, Zelle which is the big banks equivalent of P2P – that appears to add a layer of security in the eyes of an older generation because it is through the big banks that have known for years. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers,or use your imagination!)

I would suggest that Venmo provide the option for a cancellation of a payment much like Zelle provides, this would help in scenarios where the money was sent to the wrong person and give customers a bit more security. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I have seen many people move away from Venmo because they want the insurance that the money can be sent back – quickpay for Chase for example lets a payment be cancelled at any time and its helped tremendously for when payments need to be adjusted. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

There would have to be a delay in the system for sending the money out immediately, technology wise I believe that there would need to be some code in place that acts as a .50 second delay on the money sent.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 

Having the buffer would give the user time to re-evaluate that the money was sent to the correct person for the correct amount- also a feature to adjust the amount once sent. Since Venmo lives on venmo balance this should be an easy ask.
